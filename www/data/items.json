The Morgan Adams Jr. Sculpture Garden seems built to comply with the mission of the YMCA, the Young Men's Christian Association. The association, headquartered in Los Angeles, is the largest glass building dominating the space in which we find ourselves. In a neighborhood \" saturated \" with skyscrapers this garden is a much-welcomed green respite in a sea of cement.Opened in 1996 in honor of Morgan Adams Jr., a member of the YMCA Board of Directors, this space is dedicated to sport, a key element of the activities of the YMCA. Among the six sculptures donated by Morgan Adams Jr. and his family, now located in the in the Downtown YMCA, three were made in Italy.Let's begin by looking at the sculpture in bronze and stainless steel situated on a base of black granite. Created by the Swiss- Israeli artist Gidon Graetz the sculpture is named \"Body  mind, and spirit\" mirroring the ideals of the YMCA and is located on the corner of Hope and 4th Street. The artist, Gideon Graetz was born in Tel Aviv in 1929, moving to Italy in the fifties to study at the Academy of Fine Arts in Florence. In Tuscany Graetz purchased a home in Fiesole, on the hills surrounding Florence, where he also opened his own foundry, producing works inspired by the Renaissance and among them is the piece we are currently looking at. Graetz sculptures which are known for being made using a unique technique, which consists in fusing bronze and stainless steel, are exhibited all over the world. The author of the other two sculptures that you can admire in the sculpture garden is Milton Hebald. Originally from New York Hebald was awarded for three years in a row, from 1955 to 1957, with the Prix de Rome Fellowship at the American Academy in Rome where he moved with his wife, the painter Cecile Rosner Hebald. The couple lived for a long time first in Rome and then in Bracciano.  As you will notice Hebald?s bronze sculpture called \"Handstand\" stands out among the green trees thanks to the brilliance of the material and the uniqueness of the figure. The sculpture shows a young man intent in supporting the weight of his body on one hand; Hebald?s grandson might have been the model for the statute. More natural looking, but no less dynamic, are the three female figures in the bronze work titled \"Olympiad 84\". In this case too sports Hebald sought to encapsulate the energy and dynamism of sport: the girl?s ponytail and the position of the limbs embrace movement in this work that combines bronze and black. The sculpture, created 1986, is a tribute to the Olympic games that were held two years earlier in Los Angeles as well as a tribute to women that confirms officially their recognition as members of the YMCA. Both works have been created in Rome and together with Graetz?s sculpture they contribute an artistic flair to the space that surrounds us. The sculptures in the Morgan Adams Jr. Sculpture Garden provide a peaceful diversion in the middle of the bustling business district often, bringing to this lovely hidden garden a touch of Italy.If this sculpture garden is something somewhat unexpected you?ll find that the surprises are not over yet. We recommend visiting the part of the garden that runs along Flower St. and looking out from the terrace to discover the next stop on our journey.

Its unique features and its evolution make it a truly fascinating start for our journey. By the early 1900s Italian immigrants had already met their first roadblocks on the west coast of the United States, trying to fit in a society that was already rigidly structured. California, on the other hand, was a state in the making with room for everyone, and because of its exceptionality especially for the Italians. Two centuries ago the area was still a heavily Spanish-speaking one, which made it easy for new immigrants to communicate with locals given the close proximity of the two languages. A pleasant addition to that was the mild climate of the state, so similar to that of the motherland, which allowed the Italians to continue to be farmers and fishermen while learning new skills and trades to adapt to the local job reality. Many immigrants from Piedmont and Tuscany went into the viniculture and winemaking businesses, sometimes bringing plants from Italy, while those who arrived from the islands of Ischia, Sicily, and Sardinia were naturally drawn to fishing.Unlike many who were attracted to California by the Gold Rush and relied largely on their luck, Italians worked in the infrastructure that cropped up around the rush by supplying the miners with everything they needed: lodging, tools, and even food. These prosperous times made it so that by the 1900 the Italian community in Los Angeles counted about 2000 residents, all gravitating towards the square we are currently visiting. Until World War II, Los Angele?s Little Italy flourished, the attack on Pearl Harbor however, marked the beginning of the disintegration of the city?s Italian community. Suddenly the 600,000 Italians living in the United States who had not yet become American citizens were identified as \"enemy aliens.\" A period of extreme duress began for Italian immigrants; subjected to a curfew from eight in the evening to six in the morning, their properties seized, they were banned from being more than five miles away from their residences and their business and homes subject to searches and inspections. Italians who lived on the coast were forced to move to inland areas of the State: the hardest hit by this measure were the fishermen who lost their boats, among them the father of baseball star Joe DiMaggio. In this climate of fear and mistrust 400 people accused of having links with pro-Fascist organizations were arrested and tried. However, the situation was luckily short-lived, in a matter of months the US government revoked the restrictions when, in the course of the war, Italy ceased to be an enemy. However, the fate of Little Italy was forever sealed.

Arriving in 1823 Leandri soon opened a grocery and liquor store in the square next to the current Plaza Firehouse. This smart and lucky young Sardinian became in the span of a few years the first Italian justice of peace in Los Angeles and managed to put aside enough money to buy a ranch, Ranch Los Coyotes in Orange County, 50 thousand acres of land destined for the production of wine. At the time of his death his estate was estimated to be worth over 30 thousand dollars and was divided equally between his American wife and his mother in Sardinia. Twenty years later another Italian enjoyed abundant success, the Genoese Matteo Sabichi who had arrived to Los Angeles from Northern California. Sabichi built his adobe house in the south-east corner of the Plaza, and subsequently married a wealthy Mexican woman with whom he had two sons, Matthew and Francis. Following the untimely death of his wife, Sabichi decided to return to Italy with the children, losing his life in a shipwreck; his two boys were adopted by the American consul in London and although their lives had been marked by tragedy they returned to Los Angeles to a bright career: Francis, known as Frank, became the president of the Los Angeles city council. Joseph Pagliano was among the first Italian residents in Los Angeles. We know that he ran Pico House, which you can see being the largest building in this great square. Pagliano owned the place until 1953, when he sold it to the State of California. Behind the Pico House, John Sanguinetti and George A. Vignolo, who was alderman of the city, started La Esperanza Store, a store that supplied the Pico House with foods and drinks. Towards the end of the 1800s Ambrose and Anthony Vignolo Pelanconi established at the Sepulveda House on Main Street the Italian Mutual Benefit Society, an organization that was both an expression of the vitality and self-sufficiency of the Italian community in Los Angeles, providing health care to its members and their families in the event of illness, disability or death of a member. A few years later and with the same objective, the Garibaldi Union and Brotherhood Society was born. The two organizations merged in the early 1900s and are to this day still active through social and philanthropic activities. Since 1908 the society?s headquarters have been located in the Italian Hall, which we are about to visit on this tour.","type":"museum","optional":"{\"museum\":\"Pasadena\"}","tags":null,"position":{"lat":34.056553,"lng":-118.23877},"like":null,"medias":null}},{"attributes":{"stream":null,"id":"220187915","idBeacon":null,"name":"Olvera Street","mailAcq":null,"imageType":null,"img":"http://95.110.224.34:8080/img/item/220187915.png","description":"","type":"museum","optional":null,"tags":null,"position":{"lat":34.056927,"lng":-118.238434},"like":null,"medias":null}},{"attributes":{"stream":null,"id":"-961607769","idBeacon":null,"name":"Italian American Museum LA","mailAcq":null,"imageType":null,"img":"http://95.110.224.34:8080/img/item/-961607769.png","description":"<h2>Italian American Museum of Los Angeles </h2>What could be a better location for the Italian American Museum than the Italian Hall?

The Italian Hall?s story begins in 1907 and 1908, when a French woman, Marie Hammel, commissioned the Pozzo Construction Company with a two-story building on the corner of Cesar Chavez Avenue and North Main Street.Soon the Italian Hall began to host Italian cultural and social events, weddings, banquets, harvests, and dancing; an orchestra played every week in the lobby of the building. The building was for two decades the focus of the social and political life of the Italian community; on its upper floor Frank Archons opened the Societa? Italiana della Mutua Beneficenza, of which he was secretary, while on the ground floor was Hector Paggi?s bar. The Italian Hall was also home to the Archons Hardware Store.The Hall hosted the gatherings of the Garibaldi Society and of the Italian Workers Club, two of the emerging political movements in the multiethnic community of the time. Soon the Italian Hall was also hosting political debates with anarchists and revolutionaries, managing to gather up to 1,000 listeners. Imagine the excitement and the tension that these walls bore witness to, considering that at the beginning of the '900s free speech in Los Angeles was illegal. This puts in perspective the subversive potential of these debates and the reason why they were viewed with concern by the government of the city, which didn?t mind using the LAPD Red Squad to stop them.When in the thirties the Italians of Little Italy reached 30,000 units, the building became too small for the needs of a community that continued to grow, ending its role as a cultural center. Its tenants, however, continued to be Italian and in 1931 the building was home to a popular Italian restaurant.Today the Italian Hall is included in the National Register of Historic Places as one of the oldest buildings of Little Italy in Los Angeles. It is now home to the soon to be opened Italian American Museum and its 600 pieces-strong collection.","type":"museum","optional":"{\"museum\":\"Downtown\",\"originalid\":\"138\"}","tags":null,"position":{"lat":34.058006,"lng":-118.237656},"like":null,"medias":null}},{"attributes":{"stream":null,"id":"-938178265","idBeacon":null,"name":"LACMA","mailAcq":null,"imageType":null,"img":"http://95.110.224.34:8080/img/item/-938178265.png","description":"<h2>The Los Angeles County Museum of Art </h2>The Los Angeles County Museum of Art is very pleased to participate in this survey of Italian works in Southern California collections. We are remarkably well-positioned to participate with works spanning time over four millennia, from the early Etruscan period to the 21st century. LACMA holds substantial strength in Italian old master paintings covering almost every school of the peninsula, from Genoa to Naples, from Venice to Rome, Florence and Milan. It includes, among many others one of two paintings by Rosso Fiorentino in America, works by Titian, Veronese, Correggio, Vasari, Guido Reni, Pietro daCortona, and Carlo Saraceni, an impressive group of 18th century Venetian works featuring Canaletto, both Giovanni Battista and Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo, Sebastiano Ricci, Gaspare Diziani, and Pietro Longhi. The Grand Tour and early-neoclassicism are well represented, in the sumptuous Portrait of Sir Wyndham Knatchbull-Wyndham by Pompeo Batoni. The central role played by Italy in European culture is also represented in numerous French, English and German works executed in Italy, often during the formative years of the artists.Rich holdings are also to be found in LACMA?s collection of works on paper, with important examples such as Giovanni Battista Tiepolo?s A Fallen Angel, Ugo da Carpi?s magnificent chiaroscuro woodcut Diogenes (after Parmigianino), and The Head of an Apostle by Benedetto Luti.Extending into the 20th and 21st centuries LACMA highlights include Amedeo Modigliani?s Young Woman of the People and Reverie (Study for the Portrait of Frank Burty Haviland). Works of art from a more contemporary era include Michelangelo Pistoletto?s Persona Che Guarde, a collage on stainless steel, a striking Mappa by Arte Povera artist Alighiero Boetti, Mimmo Paladino Sonata, a steel, wax and tar composition by Jannis Kounellis, and several intriguing works by Maurizio Cattelan.

journey, drawing us closer to the Eighteenth century?s Grand Tour traditional itinerary. We are now looking at a crystal clear view of the Campania region, home to the city of Naples, and immediately our eyes are drawn to the outline of the Paestum temples, drawn starkly against the soft hills of the Piana del Sele and, further in the distance, the Cilento mountains. For the travellers of the time the Italian South?s gentle climate with its nights filled with the fragrant smell of flowers, and its mountains overlooking a clear sea, was always incredibly appealing. And certainly many, for those reasons, were drawn to the city of Paestum, originally called Poseidonia by its Greek founders in honor of Poseidon, the god of the sea. As we observe the painting from left to right we can see three Greek temples dedicated respectively to Athena, Poseidon, and Hera. To this day these three temples are the best preserved ones in the world, looking exactly like they did in this painting from 1759. What?s missing in Joli?s painting is the road built in 1762 to allow the travellers on the Grand Tour easy access to the temples and enjoy up close their beauty. Quick brushstrokes outline the travellers, either on foot or on horses, escorted by the guides that lead them to the temples. Only few years after the painting was completed the temples became accessible also by chariot, making it even easier to admire their beauty. In the painting we can also see how the three temples lacked a roof cover, which at the time of their construction was likely made of wood. Given the perishability of this material it is no surprise that by the 1800s the covering was no longer in place. Between Athena?s temple on the left and Poseidon?s on the right we catch a glimpse of the remains of an amphitheater, in which proximity the access road was built. Equally visible is the wall that surrounds the area; to this day this ancient architectural element remains one of the best-preserved ones in the entire complex.The author of the painting, Antonio Joli (1700-1777) born in the northern town of Modena, completed his art studies in Rome, where he moved at a young age to study with one of the greatest artists of his time, Giovanni Paolo Panini. He then moved to Venice where he came in contact with Canaletto, becoming one of the most important landscape painters of the century. Joli travelled extensively and his journeys took him to Germany, London, Madrid, and lastly Naples where he chose to spend the last 15 years of his life and where he ultimately died. Joli?s type of painting could certainly be seen as a travel guide of sorts that encouraged travellers to explore the areas and that at the same time could function as souvenirs of the journey itself. Looking at this work we can almost perceive the warmth of the air, the sense of marvel that the travellers reaching these majestic ruins must have experienced as thousands of years of history stood in all their glory before their eyes.

Italy, often called a land of 'saints, poets and navigators' is definitely also a land of churches, popular wisdom tells us that we could easily find a church?s bell tower every 150 feet or so. An element consistently present in most churches is the altarpiece, usually a pretty spectacular work designed to adorn and celebrate the most sacred place in the church. In Italy no city, town, or village is without either.The author of the spectacularly large altarpiece that we are now looking at is Guariento di Arpo (1310-1370), an accomplished artist of the fourteenth century. Born near Padua, a beautiful city in the northern Veneto region, known since the Middle Ages for its ancient and prestigious university and its philological studies as well as for the lordship of the Carrara family. And it was in this city, known as the capital of fourteenth century?s painting, adorned with sublime masterpieces such as the Scrovegni Chapel by Giotto that Guariento worked for a long time in the service of the cultivated and feared lords of Carrara and the various churches of the city and its surroundings. This wonderful Altarpiece was made for the Duomo of San Martino in Piove di Sacco, just outside the city of Padua.En route on our ideal journey we are now facing a work that is a journey in itself. As we follow each painted scene we also follow the life of the Virgin and Christ through the Gospels. The central part of the altarpiece represents the Coronation of the Virgin Mary; the mother of Christ is depicted as having the gentlest features, floating in the golden space to the right of Jesus, who is putting an exquisitely rendered crown on her head; they are surrounded by cherubs and angels who sing their praises playing musical instruments. At the top, we see in what is called ?the cusp? the scene of the Crucifixion. On the sides of the Crucifixion we can also see the Annunciation divided into two panels (The Virgin on the right-hand side and the Angel on the left), and two small scenes from the Nativity of the Virgin on the right and the Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple on the left, which we see interspersed with depictions of saints: S. Martin and the Beggar, the patron saint of both Piove di Sacco and the church itself, and Nicholas of Bari to the right. On the edge of the altarpiece we find two pairs of smaller saints: Saint Justina and St. Francis the left, and St. Prosdomichus and Saint Catherine of Alexandria to the right. The 3 bottom rows are to be read from left to right; in the top one we find four ?events?: the Nativity, the Epiphany, the Circumcision, and the Washing of the feet. While in the middle row we can see the Betrayal, the Flagellation, the heartbreaking and beautiful Deposition, and the Descent into Limbo. Lastly in the lower one we see represented the scene of the Noli Me Tangere, the Ascension, the Pentecost, and finally the Last Judgment.The refined linear technique and limpid, brilliant colors with which the work is executed together with the plasticity of Giotto?s style all contribute to making this altarpiece extremely elegant, transporting us to the precious Italian Gothic, to the churches and art that has shaped so much of the world?s history. And it?s from there that are journey continues?","type":"photo","optional":"{\"museum\":\"Watts\"}","tags":null,"position":{"lat":34.14636,"lng":-118.15925},"like":null,"medias":null}},{"attributes":{"stream":null,"id":"886139313","idBeacon":null,"name":"The Triumph of Virtue and Nobility Over Ignorance","mailAcq":null,"imageType":null,"img":"http://95.110.224.34:8080/img/item/886139313.png","description":"","type":"photo","optional":"{\"museum\":\"Watts\"}","tags":null,"position":{"lat":34.14636,"lng":-118.15925},"like":null,"medias":null}},{"attributes":{"stream":null,"id":"1249285422","idBeacon":null,"name":"Portrait of an Elderly Man","mailAcq":null,"imageType":null,"img":"http://95.110.224.34:8080/img/item/1249285422.png","description":"","type":"photo","optional":"{\"museum\":\"199\",\"originalid\":\"152\"}","tags":null,"position":{"lat":34.14636,"lng":-118.15925},"like":null,"medias":null}},{"attributes":{"stream":null,"id":"-1053613857","idBeacon":null,"name":"Rape of Proserpina (Rape of the Sabine Woman)","mailAcq":null,"imageType":null,"img":"http://95.110.224.34:8080/img/item/-1053613857.png","description":"","type":"photo","optional":"{\"museum\":\"199\",\"originalid\":\"149\"}","tags":null,"position":{"lat":34.14636,"lng":-118.15925},"like":null,"medias":null}},{"attributes":{"stream":null,"id":"255517485","idBeacon":null,"name":"Angel Playing Zither","mailAcq":null,"imageType":null,"img":"http://95.110.224.34:8080/img/item/255517485.png","description":"","type":"photo","optional":"{\"museum\":\"199\",\"originalid\":\"146\"}","tags":null,"position":{"lat":34.14636,"lng":-118.15925},"like":null,"medias":null}},{"attributes":{"stream":null,"id":"-1333327135","idBeacon":null,"name":"Angel Playing Timbrels","mailAcq":null,"imageType":null,"img":"http://95.110.224.34:8080/img/item/-1333327135.png","description":"","type":"photo","optional":"{\"museum\":\"199\",\"originalid\":\"145\"}","tags":null,"position":{"lat":34.14636,"lng":-118.15925},"like":null,"medias":null}},
